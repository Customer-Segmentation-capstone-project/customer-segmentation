## Overview

- Project Description Describes what your project is and why it is important
- Briefly describe the project goal, dataset, and problem statement.
- Project Goal Clearly states what your project sets out to do and how the information gained can be applied to the real world

Using historical eCommerce data from the Brazilian online platform OLIST, we will build a profile for Brazilian customer eCommerce spending habits to recommmend Amazon products to Brazilian customers.

The goal of our project is to identify customer segments that exhibit similar purchasing patterns and characteristics. This data could be used to target marketing strategies, which can reduce marketing costs while also increasing its effectiveness. This project can also be used to create a personalized customer shopping experience, which can increase customer satisfaction and lead to customer reorders.

We will be using publicly available data for customer purchase data from a Brazilian 


- Initial Hypotheses Initial questions used to focus your project

We have questions. Such as what are the questions?


## Dataset

- Provide a description of the dataset, including the number of records, features, and target variable.
- Include a link to the dataset source, if available.
- Data dictionary

The datasets we will be working with are a public dataset from the Brazilian eCommerce website OLIST, this dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce. 

We will be combining this customer purchase data with product data scraped from Amazon products which is located at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshparab/amazon-products-dataset.


## Setup

- Gives instructions for reproducing your work. i.e. Running your notebook on someone else's computer.
- List the required Python libraries and their versions.
- Include instructions for setting up a virtual environment, if necessary.
- Provide any additional setup instructions, if needed.

## Data Preprocessing

- Project Plan Guides the reader through the different stages of the pipeline as they relate to your project
