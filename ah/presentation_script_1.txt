For our modelling we took a multi-stage approach to segmenting our customers.

We started by identifying distinct clusters in our dataset by using the kmeans algorithm.

in order to find the ideal number of clusters we used the elbow method, which seeks to minimize the variance within each cluster while also minimizing the number of clusters needed.

We found that by using: customer_age, along with the revenue and sub_category of items purchased our ideal number of clusters was 4.

We then used these 4 clusters as the target variable on a classification model.

The best model that we found was a decision tree model which was able to predict the segment a customer would be in with an accuracy of over 98% on our test data.

Next we fed this customer cluster information into a product recommendation system in order to generate a list of Amazon products that the customer might be interested in purchasing.




Our recommmendation system works by first grouping our Amazon products dataset into 4 price ranges which correspond to the spending habits of our customer segments

It then uses Natural Language Processing and regular expressions to match the product's name to the list of sub_categories sold by the bike shop from our first dataset.

The recommender then selects products in sub categories that are most frequently purchased by each customer segment.

The products are then ordered using a combination of the item's average review score multiplied by the number of reviews the product has received.

Finally a list of products is presented based on the customer segment that was determined from our classification model.
