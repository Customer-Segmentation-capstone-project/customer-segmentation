Across the United States, there are altercations that result in killings by police officers, whether on-duty or off-duty. Each case is considered as a person dying from being shot, beaten, restrained, intentionally hit by a police vehicle, pepper sprayed, tasered, or otherwise harmed by police. 

For our capstone, we are addressing the issue of police violence that has become a heated topic throughout the country in the recent years. As a team, we will be attempting to help law enforcement agencies spot risk factors so they may step in before risk transforms into actual harm.  

The dataset we acquired from [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/aboutthedata) has gathered over 9,000 police killings from January 2013 to May 2021. Analyzing the features surrounding fatal encounters will shed light on changes to be made to save more lives. After creating a classification model to predict the threat level of the victim, we've cast a larger net and acquired the 30,000+ [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/tools-for-journalists/) dataset that was originally used to create the Mapping Police Violence dataset used in the first iteration. The final classification model we have created beat the baseline model by 20%.


<a name="project-planning"></a><h1><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/f8/d9/dbf8d911ea72d584177fac7b20735afc.png"/></h1>
### Goal: 
Analyze attributes of civilian fatalities in police altercations in the United States in order to shed light on changes to be made to save more lives. Dataset features will be used to build a classification model predicting whether the victim was indeed an attacker.


### Initial Hypotheses:

> Hypothesis₁
>
> There is relationship between bodycam usage and threat.
    
> Hypothesis₂
>
> There is a difference between male and female fatalities.
<details>
  <summary>Click to see full list. </summary>   
    
> Hypothesis₃
>
> There is a difference between mental health factor fatalities and non-mental health fatalities.
    
> Hypothesis₄
>
> The cause of death and civilian fleeing are independent.
    
> Hypothesis₅
>
> Race is a factor.
    
> Hypothesis₆
>
> More killings occur in urban vs rural areas.
   
</details>    



### Project Planning Initial Thoughts:
**Initial Questions:**
- How many fatalities happened as a result of an attack by the civilian? (alleged threat level)
- What are the fatalities by state: % killings vs pop
- Is race a factor?
- Where and what areas result in more killings?
- What is happening in suburban fatalities?
- Do symptoms of mental illness play a role in threat level?
- Are victims armed/unarmed or fleeing/not fleeing victims? Do these attributes affect alleged threat level? 
- Did the victim put others in danger?
- Is there a mental illness that contributed to the incident? 
- Are officers wearing their body cameras and does it make a difference in alleged threat level?
- Is race, gender, age or location influencing the threat level of victims?
- Is there even enough information being documented on the police reports? 
- How does mental illness affect each gender?
- Is cause of death and alleged threat level independent of one another?
- What are the most common words that appear in the description of incidents?

**First iteration:**
- Clean datatset
- Explore questions & hypotheses visually 
- Encode attributes for ML ease
- Run statistical test on hypothese
- Fill in as many blank/ambiguous observations of our target variable `alleged_threat_lvl`
- Use feature importance to narrow down list of features to feed into our ML model
- Use various classification models on split data to create the best model

**Second iteration:**
- Bring in more data via [Fatal Encounters](https://fatalencounters.org/tools-for-journalists/)!
- RE-clean
- Analyze lesser features available 
    - use feature importance to identify useful attributes
- Create a better model, we have the technology!
   
    
**Deliverables:**
- A well-documented jupyter notebook detailing the data science pipeline process.
- README.md file containing overall project information.
- Python modules that automate the data acquisition, preparation, and exploration process.
- 10-15 minute presentation along with slide deck.

## Exploration Key Findings:
### Univariate
- Most fatalities are male
- Mode of **dataset**:
    - Race is white
    - Symptoms of mental illness: No
    - Were allegedly armed
    - Had attempted to attack the police or others
    - Did not have survelliance footage 
    - Occurred with an **Off-Duty** officer


### Bivariate
- Male fatalities were 68% likely to be an attacker
    - only 20% of men had known mental illness
- Female fatalities were 59% likely to be an attacker
    - only 27% of women had known mental illness
- There is not much variation in the attack threat level and non-attack threat level among the mental illness categories.
    - Highest percentage of non-attacks are people under the influence of drugs/alcohol.
- The highest occurrence of attacks are seen in White races. Second highest appears to be Black races.
    - The highest occurrence of non-attacks are seen in Native Americans. Second highest is Hispanics.
- There seems to be more attacks than non-attacks overall, regardless if body camera is on or off.
    - When bodycam is on, there is a higher chance of a non-attack threat level, than when the body camera is off.
    - In contrast, when the body camera is off, there is a higher chance of an attack threat level, than when the body camera is on.

> #### Hypothesis₁
>
> H₀ = There is not a difference between male attackers and the remaining population.
>
> H𝛼 = Attacker status for males & total population are different.
> - **We reject the null hypothesis: There is not a difference between male attackers and the remaining population.**<br>
    **Therefore, we can move forward with alternative hypothesis: Attacker status for males & total population are different.**

> #### Hypothesis₂
>
> H₀ = Mental status is independent on alleged threat level.
>
> H𝛼 = Mental status is dependent on alleged threat level.
> - **We reject the null hypothesis: Mental status is independent of alleged threat level.**<br>
    **Therefore: Mental status is dependent on alleged threat level.**
    
> #### Hypothesis₃
>
> H₀ = There is independence between the cause of death and civilian threat level.
>
> H𝛼 = There is a dependent relationship between the cause of death and civilian threat level.
> - **We reject the null hypothesis: There is independence between the cause of death and civilian threat level.**<br>
    **Therefore: There is a dependent relationship between the cause of death and civilian threat level.**
           
    
> #### Hypothesis₄
>
> H₀ = There is independence between the use of bodycams and civilian threat level.
>
> H𝛼 = There is a dependent relationship between the the use of bodycams and civilian threat level.
> - **We reject the null hypothesis: There is independence between the use of bodycams and civilian threat level.**<br>
    **Therefore: There is a dependent relationship between the the use of bodycams and civilian threat level.**

- All models had roughly the same score for train and validate sets.
- K-Nearest neighbor model performed the worst on out-of-sample data.
- The best performing model uses a Random Forest algorithm and combined features from Select K Best and Recursive Feature Elimination lists.
- Our final Random Forest model increased by 21% from a baseline accuracy of 51% to 72% accuracy on out-of-sample data.
** Next Steps
- Fill in missing values manually as best as possible based on the description column in the dataset (large amount of data missing).
- Natural language processing exploration on description of incident.

- Most impactful features of predicting alleged threat level:
    - Armed vs. Unarmed
    - Fleeing Attempt
    - Age
    - Race
