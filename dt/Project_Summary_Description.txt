**Project Description: “ShopSense” - Personalized Product Recommendations for Bike Shop Customers**

ShopSense is an exciting data-driven project aimed at enhancing the shopping experience for customers of bike shops by providing personalized product recommendations. As a team of data scientists, our goal is to improve customer satisfaction and increase sales by leveraging historical purchasing data to deliver tailored recommendations to each individual customer.

Through advanced machine learning techniques and recommendation algorithms, we will analyze the purchasing history of bike shop customers and identify patterns and preferences. By understanding each customer's unique preferences and needs, we can offer personalized recommendations that align with their interests, resulting in a more enjoyable and efficient shopping experience.

Our approach involves applying state-of-the-art recommendation systems to the vast product catalog available on Amazon.com. We will develop a recommendation engine that utilizes customer purchase history, demographic information, and browsing behavior to generate accurate and relevant product suggestions. By harnessing the power of data, we aim to provide highly targeted recommendations that align with each customer's specific interests and needs.

**Project Goals:**
1. Improve customer satisfaction: By providing personalized recommendations, we aim to enhance the shopping experience and help customers discover products that resonate with their interests and preferences.
2. Increase sales: Tailored recommendations have the potential to boost customer engagement and drive incremental sales by showcasing relevant products to customers who are more likely to make a purchase.
3. Foster customer loyalty: By demonstrating a deep understanding of each customer's preferences, we aim to build strong customer relationships and foster loyalty within the bike shop community.

**Hypothesis Questions:**
1. Does providing personalized product recommendations based on purchasing history lead to higher customer engagement?
2. Can tailored recommendations improve the average order value by suggesting complementary products?
3. Do customers who receive personalized recommendations have a higher rate of repeat purchases?
4. Are customers more likely to leave positive reviews when they receive personalized recommendations?
5. Does the implementation of a recommender system result in increased customer satisfaction and likelihood of recommending the bike shop to others?

**Project Phases and Plans:**
1. Data Collection and Exploration:
   - Gather historical purchasing data from the bike shop's customer database.
   - Explore and analyze the data to understand customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and product categories.

2. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:
   - Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
   - Engineer relevant features such as customer demographics, product categories, and purchase history.

3. Model Development and Training:
   - Utilize state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms to develop a personalized recommendation engine.
   - Train the model using the preprocessed data and validate its performance.

4. Integration and Deployment:
   - Integrate the recommendation engine into the bike shop's website or point-of-sale system.
   - Ensure seamless integration and monitor the system's performance in real-time.

5. Evaluation and Iteration:
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of the recommendation system using relevant metrics such as customer engagement, sales, and customer satisfaction.
   - Gather feedback from customers and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and iterate on the system.
